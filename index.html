            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Ahmed ElShaikh. I'm a recent MIS graduate (full-stack specialization) from the Egyptian

                DevFest '23, ECPC '23, and Cairo ICT '22.</p>

            <p>"Through my involvement with ERU and courses taken outside, I've had the opportunity to work on various
                projects focused on developing innovative solutions and supporting student ventures. These projects have

            <h2>Projects</h2>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <img src="project.jpg" alt="Project ">
                <p>This project manages core data like customers, cars, brands, and messages, likely using a MySQL
                    database. It implements role-based access control (via PHP sessions) to manage user permissions. The
                    user interface is built with Bootstrap, and PHP handles dynamic content and database interactions.
                    The primary focus was back-end development with PHP and establishing a robust design system.</p>
